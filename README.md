# School District Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to assist the chief data scientist for a city school district prepare all standardized test data for analysis, reporting, and presentation to provide insights about performance trends and patterns. Schools' budgets were also considered when analyzing test scores and performance.

## Results and Analysis

* Generally, students at charter schools receive higher math and reading scores than students at public schools.
* When students' grade levels are taken into account, only 12th graders at public schools receive higher scores in math.
* Generally, average test scores decrease as students move up in grade level, i.e., students in 9th grade have higher average scores than students in 12th grade.
* On average, public schools have a higher school budget than charter schools.

Students at charter schools may receive higher average scores than those in public schools for a variety of reasons. Primarily, charter schools are independently run, so schools have the freedom to design classrooms that meet their students' needs. Instructors at public schools, whose curriculum is designed by the district and applied to all public schools within that district, do not have the flexibility to change curriculum and address areas where students may struggle. 

One reason students' scores decrease as they move up in grade level may be because the material has become more difficult and may require a higher-level understanding that the school may not be equipped to teach, due to the aforementioned curriculum dilemma.  Additionally, students become more preoccupied with the growing responsibilities of reaching adulthood, such as college applications, extracurriculars, or deepening commitments to their families or personal lives. Lastly, it is common for students to feel burnt out by the time they reach twelfth grade and approach the end of their high school career, which will inevitably have an effect on their test scores and academic performance.
